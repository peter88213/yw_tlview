# "Cascading" menu

The scene marks are stacked on the timeline canvas, so that they would
not overlap or cover the title of previous scenes. If the stacking
algorithm does not seem good enough to you, you can adjust its limits.

## Tight

With **Cascading > Tight**, you can arrange consecutive scenes behind each 
other, even if they are close together.

## Relaxed

With **Cascading > Relaxed**, you can arrange consecutive scenes in a stack, 
even if they are some distance apart.

## Standard

With **Cascading > Standard**, you can reset the cascading to default.

**Hint** 

- You can fine-tune the stacking limits with `Shift`-`Ctrl`-`Mousewheel`.
