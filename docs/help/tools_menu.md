### Use 00:00 for missing times

With **Tools > Options > Use 00:00 for missing times**, you get a checkbox.

 -   If checked, "00:00" is used as display time for events
     without time information. This does not modify the events.
 -   If unchecked, sections without time information are not
     displayed.
