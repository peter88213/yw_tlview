# yWriter Timeline viewer help

This page refers to the latest
[yw_tlview](https://github.com/peter88213/yw_tlview/) release. You can
open it with **Help > Online help**.



## Setting up the program 

After downloading and installing the program as described on the download page, 
you might want to make some [preparations](preparations.md) in order to make
it accessible on your desktop. 
 

## Operation

### Launching the application

- You can start the timeline viewer by dragging and dropping a *.yw7* file 
  onto the desktop shortcut, then this project will be opened. 
- If you start the timeline viewer via clicking or double-clicking on the
  program icon, the project from the last session will be automatically reopened, 
  if there is one.
- Otherwise a blank timeline view appears, and you can click on the 
  **File > Open** menu item to load an existing project file. 


### Mouse scrolling

-   Scroll the timeline horizontally with `Shift`-`Mousewheel`.
-   Scroll the timeline vertically with the mousewheel.
-   Scroll the timeline in any direction by right-clicking on the canvas
    and dragging the mouse.
-   Increase or reduce the time scale with `Ctrl`-`Mousewheel`.
-   Change the distance limits for stacking with
    `Shift`-`Ctrl`-`Mousewheel`.
